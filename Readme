# 🧪 Multi-Language Practice Projects

Welcome to my personal coding lab! This repository is a collection of small, focused projects written in **C**, **C++**, and **Java**—each crafted to reinforce programming fundamentals, explore language-specific features, and build hands-on experience through experimentation.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repo serves as a practical space for:

- Practicing syntax, logic, and core programming concepts
- Exploring data structures, algorithms, and system-level programming
- Strengthening fluency across multiple languages
- Preparing for exams, interviews, and real-world development

## 🛠️ Languages & Focus Areas

| Language | Focus Areas |
|----------|-------------|
| C        | Pointers, memory management, file I/O, system calls |
| C++      | OOP, STL, templates, exception handling |
| Java     | Classes, inheritance, collections, multithreading |

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder contains standalone mini-projects or concept demos:
├── c/ # C language practice projects ├── cpp/ # C++ practice projects ├── java/ # Java practice projects


> Projects are intentionally kept small and focused—ideal for quick learning bursts or revisiting fundamentals.

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- **Code by doing**: Theory is great, but practice makes permanent.
- **Language fluency**: Switching between C, C++, and Java builds versatility.
- **Fail fast, learn faster**: Mistakes are part of the process.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repository is a living workspace. Some projects may be incomplete, experimental, or messy by design—because learning is rarely linear.

Planned improvements:
- Add README files inside each language folder with project-specific notes
- Expand into Python and Rust for broader exposure
- Integrate basic unit testing and documentation
